<p>Unscripted musings on business life, leadership, creativity, transformation and all the myriad of other work-life events that get in the way of a good nights sleep.</p>



<p>The Squid of Despair is a conceptual summation of what can go wrong, and often does, with mind-mapping or other creative techniques.</p>



<p>Born out of an idea for a book back in 2010, David and Peter have now made this mythical beast rise once again, phoenix like (from under the ocean waves, so a bit soggy probably), to explore all matters relating to &#8216;business life, leadership, creativity, transformation and all the myriad of other work-life events that get in the way of a good nightâ€™s sleep&#8217; in the form of an unusual podcast.</p>

<p>Enabling project managers to adapt to the new technology of artificial intelligence, this first comprehensive book on the topic discusses how AI will reinvent the project world and allow project managers to focus on people.</p>



<p>Studies show that by 2030, 80 percent of project management tasks, such as data collection, reporting, and predictive analysis, will be carried out by AI in a consistent and efficient manner. This book sets out to explore what this will mean for project managers around the world and equips them to embrace this technological advantage for greater project success.</p>



<p>Filled with insights and examples from tech providers and project experts, this book is an invaluable resource for PMO leaders, change executives, project managers, programme managers, and portfolio managers. Anyone who is part of the global community of change and project leadership needs to accept and understand the fast- approaching AI technology, and this book shows how to use it to their advantage.</p>



<p>Available on Amazon world-wide.</p>

It can potentially become a key component of business profitability and sustainability.</em></p>



<p>This article would help you understand how a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/resource-management-a-comprehensive-handbook-for-project-managers/">value-driven resource management</a>&nbsp;can become a&nbsp;<strong>major game-changer for the PMO</strong>&nbsp;and become a&nbsp;<strong>profit centre</strong>&nbsp;for the business.</p>



<p><strong>2.&nbsp;How Value-Driven Resource Management can be a Game Changer for the PMO?</strong></p>



<p>Traditionally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/top-10-business-benefits-of-a-value-centric-pmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>a PMO</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;is seen as an administrative group</strong>&nbsp;setting up the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/project-management-vs-resource-management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project management</a>&nbsp;standards and generating management reports. But in the last few years, a<strong>&nbsp;PMO has started evolving into a value centre</strong>. In this journey, modern resource management has become a key player. It can potentially deliver these values to the business.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reduce Overall Project</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/reduce-resourcing-cost-by-10-30-with-modern-resource-management-software/">Resource Cost</a>&nbsp;by 10-30%</li><li><strong>Increase Billable and Strategic Utilization</strong>&nbsp;by 10-20%</li><li><strong>Futureproof Your Workforce</strong>&nbsp;Against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/beat-market-volatility-with-efficient-resource-capacity-planning/">Market Volatility</a></li><li><strong>Leverage the Skills</strong>&nbsp;Across Matrix Org. Boundaries</li><li>Improve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/effects-of-low-productivity-business-growth/"><strong>Employee Productivity</strong></a></li><li>Reduce Resource Acquisition Cost</li></ul>



<p>These benefits might sound unreal. But they are definitely achievable by a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software.php"><strong>modern resource management solution</strong></a>.</p>



<p><strong>#1 Reduce Overall Project Resource Cost by 10-30 %</strong></p>



<p>These are the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/resources-capabilities-analysis-human-resource-perspective/"><strong>capabilities</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;of a value-driven resource management solution</strong>, which can help a business&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/reduce-resourcing-cost-by-10-30-with-modern-resource-management-software/">reduce overall project resource cost by 10-30%</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Minimize under/over skilled resources on projects</strong>: Both over and under-skilled resources increase the cost of the project. A&nbsp;<strong>modern resource management solution</strong>&nbsp;can help in&nbsp;<strong>identifying and&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/5-best-methods-successful-resource-allocation-2/"><strong>allocating the right person</strong></a>&nbsp;with the right level of skill and experience.</p>



<p><strong>Utilize cost-efficient global and local resources</strong>: An&nbsp;<strong>enterprise-level resource management solution</strong>&nbsp;can help you in&nbsp;<strong>allocating the right mix of local and global resources</strong>&nbsp;to the project. It can reduce resource cost significantly.</p>



<p><strong>Minimize last-minute hiring cost and compromises</strong>: With proper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software/capacity-planning-software.php"><strong>resource capacity planning</strong></a><strong>, one can forecast the future resource requirements</strong>&nbsp;and be proactive in acquiring the right resources at the right cost ahead of time.</p>



<p><strong>Minimize hiring/firing wastage</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>Resource forecasting</strong>&nbsp;can help in&nbsp;<strong>identifying resource shortage ahead of time</strong>&nbsp;so that the internal staffs can be retrained or hire consultant or freelancer resources for short durations. It reduces unnecessary wastage due to hiring and firing.</p>



<p><strong>Minimize Project Onboarding and Offboarding Time</strong>: An&nbsp;<strong>efficient and accurate&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software/planning-allocation-software.php"><strong>resource planning</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;and forecasting</strong>&nbsp;can help a PMO minimize onboarding and offboarding time.</p>



<p><strong>#2 Increase Billable and Strategic Utilization by 10-20%</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/maximize-profitable-resource-utilization-with-modern-resource-management-software/"><strong>Maximizing billable utilization</strong></a>&nbsp;of resources in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/5-professional-services-trends-watch/"><strong>professional service</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;business</strong>&nbsp;is the key to&nbsp;<strong>profitability and sustainability</strong>. Similarly,&nbsp;<strong>maximizing strategic utilization</strong>&nbsp;of the resources is key to achieve the strategic goal of the business.</p>



<p><strong>Improving billable and strategic&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.saviom.com/saviom_new/blog/how-to-measure-different-types-of-resource-utilization/"><strong>resource utilization</strong></a>&nbsp;requires deep foresight into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/track-resource-utilization/"><strong>overall utilization of resources</strong></a>. It is challenging work, especially in a matrix organization with a continually changing resource demand. But a&nbsp;<strong>modern resource management solution</strong>&nbsp;can help you get a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software/capacity-planning-software.php"><strong>real-time foresight</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;into future resource utilization</strong>. So that corrective actions can be taken ahead of time.</p>



<p><strong>#3 Futureproof Your Workforce Against Market Volatility</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/beat-market-volatility-with-efficient-resource-capacity-planning/"><strong>Market volatility</strong></a>&nbsp;in the last few years is continuously impacting the viability of every business. A smart&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/comprehensive-guide-to-resource-capacity-planning/"><strong>resource capacity planning</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;process</strong>&nbsp;can help you forecast a shortage or excesses of the resources and&nbsp;<strong>help you take proactive action</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Bridge Resource Shortage Proactively</strong></p>



<ul><li>Retraining existing employees</li><li>Smoothening the project workload</li><li>Hiring contingent resources ahead of time</li></ul>



<p><strong>Forward Plan and Utilize Excess Resources</strong></p>



<ul><li>Bringing forward future projects</li><li>Selling resource time aggressively</li><li>Restructuring capacity in different areas</li></ul>



<p><strong>#4 Leverage the Skills of Resources Across Matrix Org. Structure</strong></p>



<p><strong>In a matrix organization structure</strong>, it may be challenging to acquire a particular skilled resource in one location compared to others. With an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/10-best-practices-of-resource-management-software/"><strong>enterprise resource management solution</strong></a><strong>, a PMO can easily identify the person with the right competencies</strong>&nbsp;and utilize him/her in any part of the world. At the same time, a high skilled person also can be used to provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/top-7-business-benefits-of-training-scheduling-software/">training</a>&nbsp;and to a person on the bench.</p>



<p><strong>#5 Improve Employee Communication and Productivity</strong></p>



<p><strong>A value-driven resource management solution</strong>&nbsp;provides&nbsp;<strong>end-to-end work management</strong>&nbsp;along with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/5-ways-to-improve-collaboration-between-departments/"><strong>collaboration</strong></a>&nbsp;to ensure that employees are working productively onsite and remotely. This solution can help a business:</p>



<ul><li>Track status and time spent on both planned and unplanned work</li><li>Enable workflows toÂ <strong>streamline project andÂ </strong><a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/manage-resources-effectively/"><strong>resource management processes</strong></a></li><li>EnableÂ <strong>seamlessÂ </strong><a href="https://www.saviom.com/professional-service-automation/team-collaboration.php"><strong>team collaboration</strong></a>Â to improve communication</li></ul>



<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Best Practices of Enterprise Resource Management Software</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/how-to-manage-resources-in-agile-project-management/"><strong>Resource management</strong></a>&nbsp;has evolved a lot during the last few years.&nbsp;<strong>Matured businesses have adopted well-developed and defined practices</strong>&nbsp;to get the best value out of their enterprise resources. Following are the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/10-best-practices-of-resource-management-software/">best practices</a>&nbsp;adopted across the industries.</p>



<p><strong>Enterprise Resource Scheduling: Replace Silos with a Single Plan</strong><br><a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/how-outdated-resource-scheduling-and-management-tools-are-hurting-businesses/"><strong>Replace silos of spreadsheets</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;or home-grown tools</strong>&nbsp;with a single real-time resource plan across the whole enterprise. Establish a single source of truth about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/resource-allocation-a-guide-on-how-to-apply-it-on-project-management/">resource allocations</a>&nbsp;to the projects or non-project work such as BAU, Support, admin, operation, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Workforce Optimization: Allocate Right Resource to the Right Project</strong><br><strong>Identify cost-effective competent resources</strong>&nbsp;with a click of a button across a matrixed organization structure so that the right resource can be allocated to the right project at the right time at the right cost.</p>

<p><strong>Pipeline Project Management: Forecast Proactively for Future Projects</strong><br><strong>Forward plan&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/using-the-resource-based-view-strategy-for-competitive-advantage/"><strong>resource requirements</strong></a>&nbsp;for future or pipeline projects. Start identifying and acquiring cost-efficient competent resources ahead of time.&nbsp;<strong>Avoid last-minute hiring</strong>&nbsp;and reduces the overall cost of the project.</p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;How to Select a Resource Management Software</strong></p>



<p>Even though the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/how-to-select-a-perfect-resource-management-software/"><strong>fundamental principles of resource management</strong></a>&nbsp;may be the same, but every business has a set of unique requirements for the software. It depends upon the industry and type of business. So,&nbsp;<strong>selecting the right resource management tool</strong>&nbsp;is a complex process that requires a number of careful considerations.</p>



<p>Following are some of these criteria that can be used to evaluate the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software.php">right resource management software</a>: â€“</p>



<p><strong>User Interface and User Experience</strong><br>An essential part of software selection is that the end-user of the product likes user interface and can navigate through the system effortlessly without going thru too many clicks.</p>



<p><strong>Manages Complexity of Matrix Organization Structure</strong><br><strong>Matrixed organization</strong>&nbsp;structure has multiple reporting lines making resource identification,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/resource-allocation-a-guide-on-how-to-apply-it-on-project-management/">allocation</a>, utilization very hard. So, the software should be capable of&nbsp;<strong>overcoming challenges of such complexities and&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/managing-resources-across-multiple-projects/"><strong>manage resource efficiently</strong></a>&nbsp;and take care of the needs of different stakeholders.</p>



<p><strong>Needs to be Configurable, Expandability and Scalable</strong><br>The software should be&nbsp;<strong>highly configurable</strong>&nbsp;to meet the specific needs of the business without compromise so that the business would have a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/using-the-resource-based-view-strategy-for-competitive-advantage/"><strong>competitive edge</strong></a>&nbsp;against the rivals. The software should also be&nbsp;<strong>expandable and scalable</strong>&nbsp;as per the growing needs of the business.</p>



<p><strong>Capability to Reduce Resource Cost</strong><br><strong>Resource management software</strong>&nbsp;should help your business to do&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software/capacity-planning-software.php"><strong>multi-dimensional forecasting</strong></a>&nbsp;so that the business can get&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software/reports.php">real-time business intelligence</a>&nbsp;to improve business performance, profitability, and productivity.</p>



<p><strong>Provides Real-Time Business Intelligence</strong><br><a href="https://www.saviom.com/blog/how-to-measure-resource-capacity-and-demand/"><strong>Resource demand</strong></a>&nbsp;changes every minute in real life. So, it is crucial to&nbsp;<strong>have real-time&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software/reports.php"><strong>business intelligence</strong></a>, i.e. reports, analytics, and dashboards. It enables the management taking decisions based on the latest information</p>



<p><strong>Integrates with Other Legacy Systems</strong><br>Most businesses have already invested in enterprise-level systems. They hold quite a bit of data required by a resource management solution, i.e., resource profile, competencies, project detail, etc. So,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software.php"><strong>the resource management system</strong></a>&nbsp;must&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saviom.com/resource-management-software/integration-workflow.php"><strong>integrate seamlessly</strong></a>&nbsp;with existing applications.</p>



<p><strong>Provides High Return on Investment</strong><br>Select a tool that provides a&nbsp;<strong>high return on investment</strong>&nbsp;in a short time. It should be possible to have a small phase of implementation without lots of investment so that the risk of investment and change management can be minimized.</p>

<p>It was (and I still can&#8217;t quite believe this) one year ago that I last stepped off a plane after a visit to Geneva and Zurich to deliver a series of presentations and workshops for CERN and PMI Switzerland.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/3edc6bde-4819-4614-9b04-6720bc207e8e/My%20Last%20Flight.png/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280" alt="" /></figure>



<p>At approximately (this is flying after all, and Heathrow) 5:25pm GMT I walked off a plane without a clue as to what was about to happen (and I expect not alone in that either).</p>



<p>Beyond some rise in the Covid-19 news and more than the usual number of passengers and airport staff wearing masks, all was normal.</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t normal at all.</p>



<p>We know that now!</p>



<p>This is the longest period in my life that I have not flown, since, well, since I started flying I think. You don&#8217;t do my type of work (project management, PMO leadership at a global level, keynote speaking, consultancy and training) without clocking up some pretty impressive airmiles and flight status.</p>



<p>It has, in more than one way, been an astonishing year.</p>



<p>My work dropped off a cliff by April 2020, with my pipeline dropping 75% in the space of two weeks. The demand for keynote speakers, trainers and consultancy seemed to almost magically disappear (and I am talking diabolical magic and not fluffy bunnies out of a top hat type of magic).</p>



<p>But I readjusted my service offerings, became a &#8216;black-belt&#8217; in Zoom (and other) tools, and slowly rebuilt my business to a point where it looked like the children wouldn&#8217;t starve and we would have a roof over our heads.</p>



<p>And then came lockdown 2.0 (and then a little later in the year) lockdown 3.0.</p>



<p>For the second time in 12 months I readjusted my business to meet what market there was and became a PM &#8216;influencer&#8217; working with companies like Wrike, Clarizen, Microsoft, Sharktower, and more.</p>



<p>And guess what? I am still standing and looking forward to an end to lockdown number three and a gradual return to whatever the new normal will be.</p>



<p>Hell, I am a project manager and I thrive on change right?</p>



<p>It hasn&#8217;t all been bad.</p>



<p>So much time spent at home with my partner (although a twice delayed wedding so far&#8230;).</p>



<p>So much walking and seeing my local sights (with a hint of getting slightly fitter perhaps).</p>



<p>A new vegetable garden planned and prepared.</p>



<p>Two new books written, including my 21 day challenge book with contributors round the world (The Projectless Manager), and two more on the way (AI and PM, and Project Teams).</p>



<p>An amazing role with Perflo (<a href="http://www.perflo.co%29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.perflo.co)</a>&nbsp;as expert advisor for this unique project people orientated technology.</p>



<p>New keynote topics developed and ready (just call please).</p>



<p>Virtual training courses built from the ground up to be truly effective remotely delivered.</p>



<p>A great partnership with the team at Office Timeline (<a href="http://www.officetimeline.com%29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.officetimeline.com)</a>&nbsp;a brilliant PowerPoint add in for project reporting.</p>



<p>Won the PMO Influencer of the Year award.</p>



<p>Plus a few more &#8216;irons in the fire&#8217;.</p>



<p>But I do honestly miss the travel, 2019 offered me Rio, Orlando, Rovinj amongst others, so if you are planning a &#8216;real&#8217; conference in the future please get in touch. After all, how many other keynote speakers have had hundreds of project managers singing &#8216;Let it go&#8217; from Frozen, or hundreds of PMO people all doing a &#8216;Mexican&#8217; wave, or hundreds more wearing a red nose because it was cool and funny?</p>



<p>Exactly, The Lazy Project Manager is unique.</p>



<p>Call me.</p>



<p>Stay safe and here&#8217;s to a better 2021 for the whole world.</p>

<p>If your project is in need of copy for a newsletter, blog, or social post, your first instinct may be to simply email or direct message someone from your content team with the request. But while content needs may feel like one-off tasks, this approach is a great way to get subpar results and watch things fall through the cracks. So how can project managers assign content writing in the most effective, results-driven way? Read on for our guide to getting your content right.</p>



<p><strong>Selecting Your Topics</strong></p>



<p>First, you need to know your content needs. Sometimes, a project requires content thatâ€™s for internal use only. If thatâ€™s the case, youâ€™ll still need to help define your assignment and ensure itâ€™s engaging. But if content creation is meant for outside consumption, thatâ€™s where a clear strategy will most benefit you in the long-run.</p>



<p>If youâ€™re looking to assign content that will drive users to you, youâ€™ll want to start by deciding on which keywords will bring the right audience. There are<a href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/"> </a><a href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/">a few different</a><a href="https://moz.com/explorer"> </a><a href="https://moz.com/explorer">keyword search engines</a> available to help you figure out the best phrases youâ€™ll need your content writer to include in their copy. Incorporating those keywords in the title, meta description, first paragraph of copy and alt text of any images used are some of the<a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-use-keywords-in-your-blogging-strategy"> </a><a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-use-keywords-in-your-blogging-strategy">best ways to use key phrases</a>.</p>



<p>Just because keywords are important for optimizing content doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re the <em>most</em> important when it comes to <a href="https://sparxoo.com/2020/06/03/is-content-marketing-still-relevant/">content marketing assignments</a>. Ultimately, if users are brought to your content via an organic search, but they feel itâ€™s generalized, poorly written, or simply unhelpful, youâ€™ll lose them quickly and possibly permanently. Keyword searches can help you pick overarching topics you will assign to your content writer but take this further by brainstorming unique topics that your writer can go in-depth on. Optimizing the user experience will help keep readers on your page longer, and engage them better with content, which will make your overall efforts much more worthwhile.</p>



<p><strong>Organizing Assignments</strong></p>



<p>Once you have content to assign, youâ€™ll save yourself time and confusion by structuring the way you assign it. Whether you already have a<a href="https://croow.com/blog/10-best-asana-alternatives-for-project-management/"> </a><a href="https://croow.com/blog/10-best-asana-alternatives-for-project-management/">collaborative project management tool</a>, or are<a href="https://croow.com/blog/project-management-features/"> </a><a href="https://croow.com/blog/project-management-features/">looking to find one that will suit your needs</a>, using this kind of software ensures transparency and clarity when it comes to assignments, team workloads, and deadlines.</p>



<p>Speaking of deadlines, it is critical that you set clear and reasonable deadlines when assigning tasks to content writers. If you are unsure of how long a task might take, you can always work with your writers to better understand how many hours will need to go into research, writing, and editing a piece. You can also look for a project management tool that includes time-tracking so that if you have repeated assignments, you can track how long they take and adjust future deadlines accordingly.</p>



<p>It is also essential that in the assignment phase, you include<a href="https://www.clearvoice.com/blog/how-to-format-writers-assignment/"> </a><a href="https://www.clearvoice.com/blog/how-to-format-writers-assignment/">all of the necessary context and details a copywriter will need to produce the best content</a>. This includes any keywords you want your writer to use in the piece, the audience the content is meant for, the desired length or word count, and any additional information you know you need the final product to include. The more details you can provide to your writer upfront, the more likely youâ€™ll end up with what you need on the first try.</p>



<p><strong>Optimize for Results</strong></p>



<p>When your copywriter has turned in an assignment, the work isnâ€™t quite over yet. Depending on your organization, either they or you will need to<a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-blog-posts-that-rank-in-googles-top-10/"> </a><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-blog-posts-that-rank-in-googles-top-10/">review the content to ensure it is optimized</a> to the best of your ability. It might help you to<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization"> </a><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization">create a standard checklist for optimization</a> that your team uses to review each piece of content before it is published. This list should include things like confirming keywords are included in the right places within the content, making sure the content is mobile-friendly if thatâ€™s a possible platform it will be consumed on, adjusting URL structures, and linking to other relevant internal content where possible. A final review of content for SEO is a great way to make sure that all of the effort that goes into creating a great piece of content has the best chance of being discovered by the right audience.</p>



<p><strong>Planning Ahead</strong></p>



<p>If youâ€™re overseeing a project that needs content produced over a longer period of time, youâ€™ll do yourself many favors by creating a content calendar. Rather than simply addressing and assigning needed content as it comes up in your project timeline, creating a content calendar at the beginning of a projectâ€™s lifecycle can help you get ahead, make more strategic decisions about what content you need created, and can allow your writers to be ahead of schedule, making them more flexible if sudden changes are necessary.</p>



<p>Planning ahead also makes it much easier to create a strategy for writing content that links together. Back-linking existing content boosts its credibility and optimization, so building out a content calendar that has continuity while offering unique coverage can really help.</p>



<p>Finally, make sure you are analyzing the success of content as it is published. If you find that certain topics draw in the most readers, look to beef up your content around that topic so you are seen as the expert. Wherever you can learn from your success and duplicate it, you should.</p>



<p>As you find yourself manager content writers across your projects, adopting some of these best practices will help you get the most out of their work, and keep you on schedule, with mindful content choices that play into an overall project strategy.</p>
